The case is designed in a way so both parts can be printed without any supports. I printed them with a 0.6mm nozzle with .25mm layer height and arachne enabled and they came out perfect. 

Use two self-tapping M3-Screws to close the case with the board sandwiched between the two parts. 

The included lbx file can be printed on a P-Touch printer with 12mm tape. After cutting of a few mm on the right it can be aligned with the connectors. I used clear tape with white ink to get a nice effect on a black case.
