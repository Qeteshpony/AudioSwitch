[Hardware Documentation](https://qeteshpony.github.io/AudioSwitch)

Takes one 6.3mm stereo or two 6.3mm mono plugs on each in- and output

The signal goes from the input to one of the outputs, depending on the switch position

Always use the left channel connector for stereo plugs, leave the right channel open in that case

Dual mono and single stereo conections can be mixed

### Needed parts

The audio connectors are NEUTRIK NRJ6HF - I use the -AU version because I can, but the standard version should work just fine

The switch is a C&K PVA2EEH31.7NV2
